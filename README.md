# Digital Closet Application

## Increase the efficiency and effectiveness of getting dressed!

*What will this application do?*

This digital closet will allow fashion-minded users to visualize and plan their outfits ahead of time. 
Users will be able to upload images of their clothing items onto the app. Then, when they're choosing their outfits, 
they can experiment with different combinations of clothing items without having to physically try anything on.
The clothing items can be manually sorted based on type (eg: shirt, pants, shoes, etc) and colour. 
Therefore, when the user is on the app, they can filter through their clothing options based on the vibe they're going 
for. The user interface will display the uploaded pictures of the chosen clothes, so as to give the user an idea 
of what they would look like all together (eg: a stack of images with a shirt on top, pants in the middle, and shoes 
at the bottom).

*Who is the target audience?*

Anybody that is interested in putting more effort into their style could greatly benefit from this application. 
Coming up with an outfit combination in the morning can take up a lot of valuable time. Especially if you're physically
trying on the clothes. Thus, anybody that's willing to put in any effort into their outfits and appearance would use 
this app.

*Why does this project interest me?*

This project is loosely based on a fictional computer app portrayed in the movie, Clueless. I vividly remember seeing 
a scene of Cher using the app when I was a young girl. I thought that it was so cool and sophisticated, and I was 
very disappointed upon realizing no such app had existed in real life. Therefore, I would love to bring
this childhood dream to life myself! Moreover, I also love experimenting with fashion in my daily life. However, 
I often find myself feeling tired and lazy in the mornings, and I end up just throwing on a pair of jeans and a 
sweatshirt. I think an app like this could help me improve my own daily style as well!
